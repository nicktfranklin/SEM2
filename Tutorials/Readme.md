# Tutorials    


There are a few prepackaged tutorials in Jupyter notebooks meant to demonstrate basic functions of the model. They can
all be run in Google colab (the accompanying jupyter notebooks have been pre-run and can be viewed in GitHub)

* Demo - Segmentation and Memory Tutorial

    This brief tutorial walks through some basic functions of segmentation and the memory model in a toy 2-d world.  This also includes a comparison between SEM and an HMM in Memory.

* Demo - Toy Data (Segmentation)

    These simulations demonstrate how SEM can segement simple, 2D dynamical systems with
    various different methods of estimating the event dynamics of the system.
